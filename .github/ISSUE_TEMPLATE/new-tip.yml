        Thanks for taking the time to submit a new Tip-of-the-Day.
        Before proceeding, please make sure that your tip has not been added already, by [browsing the online tips](https://deken.puredata.info/tip-of-the-day/).

        The Tips-of-the-Day will ultimately be displayed at Pd startup.
        This means, that any fancy markdown formatting will be lost.  It also means, that *only* GIF images are supported (even if GitHub let's you upload MP4-files, these will not be usable).

        Please fill out the form to create a new tip.  Once reviewed, it will be automatically included in the collection.

        (If you only have a vague idea about a missing tip, just file a [feature request](https://github.com/pd-externals/tipoftheday-plugin/issues/new) instead...)

        Due to a bug in a script, it seems that you currently should not use double quotes (e.g '"') in the *Details*. We are working on a fix... Until then, use single quotes.

        If your patch is buggy and misbehaves, chances are high that this is because of an ill-defined order-of-execution, easily caused by connecting a single message outlet to multiple inlets.

        Instead, use [trigger] so you get a defined order-of-execution.
